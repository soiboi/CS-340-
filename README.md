	Maintainability in programming is critical to creating a durable and robust program. 
  This comes with creating functions that are adaptable as well as developing code that is legible. 
  In the project we developed for Grazio Salvare, the CRUD module helped make the program malleable, 
  in the sense that you would not have to make many individual functions to perform operations. 
  In the future I believe you would add to user experience by allowing them to input or modify data directly through the application. 
  You could make input boxes to ask if they would like to add a user or administrator and then the object added would update to the table as well. 
  I think as far as features in the project go you can always make things better. 
  For instance, we could have allowed the user to select an animal on the data table and then that would pop up on the map and the graph. 
  
  Computer scientists, in my opinion, are logicians as well as artists. 
  We can apply the concepts to make the program efficient and, in this case, give a user-friendly experience. 
  I think for a company like Grazio Salvare, a computer scientist should always be thinking how can I make this program more efficient, coherent and captivating.
